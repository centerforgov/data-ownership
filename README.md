# Data Ownership and Usage Terms for Government Contracts

## Introduction

An effective government data management strategy establishes practices to ensure data is treated as a valuable asset under the direction of public officials. This data may be maintained by government employees or others on the government’s behalf, and it may be available through internally-managed technology platforms or third-party cloud-based solutions. In many cases government data is accessed, maintained, and analyzed by a combination of all of the above. Unfortunately, it is common for contractors, consultants, software providers, or other entities to claim rights to government data, inhibiting its use as a helpful resource, increasing the total cost of ownership, and barring innovation.

This document provides a selection of sample language intended to be included in any or all contracts established between a government and other parties. This language is designed to preserve the government’s ownership of its data while respecting the intellectual property considerations which must be addressed when using third-party products to store, manipulate, analyze, or otherwise use its data. This preservation of ownership, while good practice on its own, enables the public release of data at the sole discretion of the government, without limitations imposed by third-parties.

The following sample language is intended to be used à la carte; individual elements can be adopted as needed at the discretion of the government. However, governments are strongly encouraged to use all of these elements as part of standard terms for all future contracts.

## Contract Terms

**Note**: This document is intended to solely address considerations of data ownership. As such, it does not address - and can not - supersede any party’s responsibilities under applicable federal, state, or local laws which define sensitive data or how it must be protected. Additionally, the sample language below cannot supercede unilateral terms and conditions imposed by service providers, such as cloud-based technology platforms, unless a specific, separate written agreement is created and executed by both parties.

Government Data: data which describes the operations of a government; electronic records which the government maintains to do its business; statistical information created or maintained by or on behalf of and an agency that records a measurement, transaction, or determination related to the mission of an agency.

        <dd>
          The term "Government Data" is used frequently in the sections of legal language below. When using any of the below sections in a contract, this definition should be included also.

The Vendor hereby assigns without any requirement of further consideration all right, title, or interest the Vendor may have to the Government Data, including any copyrights or other intellectual property rights to the same.
The Vendor hereby warrants that the Licensed Product is able to does not maintain, store, or export the Government Data using a database structure, data model, entity relationship diagram or equivalent which is itself a trade secret or which would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the Vendor if published.
Subject to the provisions of <code>[SPECIFY SECTION OR ATTACHMENT]</code>, the Agency hereby grants to Vendor a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide:
      <ol>
        <li>know-how license to internally use the Government Data for the sole purpose of enabling Vendor to develop, test, and support Agency’s use of the Licensed Product;</li>
        <li>copyright license to internally reproduce, internally display, and internally distribute the Government Data; and</li>
        <li>copyright license to reproduce, display, distribute, and create derivative works of the Government Data upon the request of the Agency.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>What This Is</dt>
      <dd>
        This requires the vendor to waive any copyright claim to the data in the database, and likewise requires the vendor to agree that the database structure itself isn’t a trade secret. Instead, the government grants the vendor certain copyright licenses so they can use it as needed to provide the services they have been contracted to do.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <dt>Why It Is Here</dt>
      <dd>
        This prevents the vendor from claimining copyright to data which is stored and/or maintained by the vendo on behalf of the government. Sometimes vendors claim that their database stores government data in a format or schema which is itself a trade secret. Those vendors may require agencies to alert them when anyone files a Freedom of Information request for government data from that database. The vendor then interferes (administratively or legally) with the FOI request, taking advantage of the law’s exemptions for trade secrets. 

        The three licenses granted by the agency to the vendor protects the vendor from being sued for making specific, limited uses of the data. Otherwise, it would be copyright infringement for the vendor to store the data in cloud servers, for example.

            Any copyright license – including the ones here – is only a good defense for copyright lawsuits; these licenses do not affect the agency’s or the vendor’s responsibilities under privacy laws such as HIPAA, FERPA, and so on.

            These licenses are describing the actions for which the vendor cannot be sued for copyright infringement. Subsequent portions of this boilerplate lay out a subset of actions which the vendor can take with government data.

          Such file formats include, but are not limited to, plain text files such as comma-delimited tables, extensible markup language, and javascript object notation. Government Data which is stored in binary formats, including but not limited to portable document format, JPEG, and portable network graphics files, shall instead be reproducible in the same format in which it was loaded into the Licensed Product.
        </li>
        <li>
          This reusable copy must be made available in a publicly documented and non-proprietary format, with a clearly-defined data structure and a data dictionary for all terms of art contained in the data. For purposes of this section, non-proprietary formats include formats for which royalty-free codecs are available to end-users.

	    This requires the vendor to provide tools that do not limit data to use with a specific product or make it otherwise inaccessible. They must make the data available in bulk, and in a format which is not proprietary. In the situation where the government provides the vendor with the data in a proprietary format (for example, a PDF file), the vendor need only return the data the way it was given to them. In addition, documentation must be provided by the vendor so that the exported data can be easily understood and consumed by the government.

        Generally, this shouldn't be an issue, because the Vendor has already waived its copyright claims to any of the government data. But we want to make absolutely clear that the Vendor doesn’t have any intellectual property rights to the data or whatever goes in inside the system.

        The Vendor has already promised that they have the right to give away the intellectual property rights to the government data and the system that the database uses. If the Vendor is wrong, the Agency could get sued. If that happens, the Vendor will be on the hook for the legal defense.
